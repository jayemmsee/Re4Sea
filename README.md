# Re4Sea
Resilience for Southeast Asia (Re4SEA)

Resilience for Southeast Asia (Re4SEA) is a web-map is aimed to integrate climate change risk considerations into off-grid energy system planning. This is a first approach to facilitate the usage and application of gathered data for resilient energy system planning. The web-map provides an overview of climate change risks occurring on Southeast Asian islands and gives recommendations on how to mitigate these risks by suggesting adaptation measures for system components. It also includes estimations of cost structures to implement these measures and demand increases based on climate change effects. The results (adjusted investment cost per system component and increased demand) may serve as input parameters to common energy system planning tools. 

Preparation
Pre-requisites: access to a terminal, nodejs, npm, Mapbox API key, GeoServer.

If NodeJS is not yet installed, the instruction
	npm install
can be followed to carry out the installation of NodeJS via package manager  this is in-order to get updates and other NodeJS dependencies and resolves all the dependencies of web application and installs all required packages. 

To run the project use the:
	npm start 

The data source was uploaded using Geoserver as a service on a local machine. The steps to setup Geoserver and upload datasources can be found on:
